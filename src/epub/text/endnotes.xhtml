					<p>Lassalle personally, to us, always acknowledged himself to be a disciple of Marx, and, as such, stood on the ground of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Manifesto</i>. But in his public agitation, 1862⁠–⁠64, he did not go beyond demanding cooperative workshops supported by State credit. <a href="preface.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>By “bourgeoisie” is meant the class of modern Capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage-labor. By proletariat, the class of modern wage-laborers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labor-power in order to live. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>That is, all written history. In 1847, the prehistory of society, the social organization existing previous to recorded history, was all but unknown. Since then, Haxthausen discovered common ownership of land in Russia, Maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and by and by village communities were found to be, or to have been the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner organization of this primitive Communistic society was laid bare, in its typical form, by Morgan’s crowning discovery of the true nature of the Gens and its relation to the Tribe. With the dissolution of these primeval communities society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempted to retrace this process of dissolution in: <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="de">Der Ursprung der Familie, des Privateigenthums und des Staats</i>, 2nd edition, Stuttgart, 1886. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Commune” was the name taken, in France, by the nascent towns even before they had conquered from their feudal lords and masters, local self-government and political rights as the “Third Estate.” Generally speaking, for the economical development of the bourgeoisie, England is here taken as the typical country; for its political development, France. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This applies chiefly to Germany where the landed aristocracy and squirearchy have large portions of their estates cultivated for their own account by stewards, and are moreover, extensive beetroot sugar manufacturers and distillers of potato spirits. The wealthier British aristocracy are, as yet, rather above that; but they, too, know how to make up for declining rents by lending their names to floaters of more or less shady joint-stock companies. <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
